# ConsentCookieManager

This is a base chrome extension for a Consent Cookie Manager. To use this, check it out locally, and use chrome
to load an 'Unpacked Extension'.

## TODO
* Add cookie generating logic for IABE consent cookies.
* Update list of sites to set cookie on according to IAB domains in use.
* Automatically update cookies on a schedule. Perhaps on launch?
* Proper icon set.
* A UI that clearly explains what this is for, and how it works.
